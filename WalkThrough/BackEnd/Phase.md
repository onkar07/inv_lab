### Phase 1: **Set Up Database and Backend Connection**
1. **Create Database Configuration**: 
   - Set up the connection between Spring Boot and MySQL.
   - Configure `application.properties` or `application.yml` to include the database connection details (URL, username, password).
   - Test the connection using Spring Boot’s `DataSource` bean.
   
2. **Create Entity Classes for Database**:
   - Create the `Category` and `Item` entity classes.
   - Define relationships between the entities if necessary (e.g., one-to-many between Category and Item).
   
3. **Create Repositories**:
   - Create Spring Data JPA repositories for both `Category` and `Item` entities.
   - Define basic CRUD operations in the repository interfaces.

4. **Database Initialization**:
   - Verify that the tables are correctly created in the database and can be accessed.

### Phase 2: **Create Category and Item Tables in Database**
1. **Define Category Entity**:
   - Create fields such as `id`, `name`, `description`, etc.
   - Add JPA annotations to define the table structure.

2. **Define Item Entity**:
   - Create fields such as `id`, `name`, `category_id` (foreign key), `quantity`, etc.
   - Add JPA annotations for the table and relationship.

3. **Test Entity Creation**:
   - Test if the tables are created successfully by running the application.
   - Ensure the relationship between `Category` and `Item` is correctly reflected in the database.

### Phase 3: **Set Up Security and JWT Authentication**
1. **Set Up Spring Security**:
   - Configure Spring Security to secure the endpoints.
   - Implement a basic security configuration class (`WebSecurityConfig.java`).

2. **Implement JWT Authentication**:
   - Create JWT utility classes for generating and parsing JWT tokens.
   - Create authentication and authorization filters to intercept requests and validate JWT tokens.

3. **Create JWT-based Registration and Login**:
   - Implement `User` registration (user creation) with password hashing.
   - Implement login to authenticate and generate JWT tokens for valid users.

4. **Secure APIs with JWT**:
   - Secure the backend API endpoints (like Category and Item CRUD operations) by adding JWT validation.
   - Only allow authorized users with valid tokens to access specific resources.

---

### Phase 4: **Create Registration & Login System**
1. **User Entity**:
   - Create the `User` entity (you’ve already defined `username`, `password`, `email`, and `roles`).
   - Include validation annotations for each field.

2. **Create Registration Endpoint**:
   - Implement an endpoint for new users to register (POST `/api/auth/register`).
   - Hash passwords using a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., BCrypt).

3. **Create Login Endpoint**:
   - Implement an endpoint for users to log in (POST `/api/auth/login`).
   - On successful login, generate and return a JWT token.
   
4. **Test Authentication**:
   - Test the registration and login functionality.
   - Make sure that the JWT token is generated and can be used for subsequent API calls.

---

### Phase 5: **Front-End Integration (ReactJS)**
1. **Create Front-End Registration and Login Forms**:
   - Create forms for user registration and login in ReactJS.
   - Send requests to the Spring Boot backend for registration and login, and handle the JWT token in the frontend.

2. **Handle JWT Token in React**:
   - Store the JWT token securely in the browser (e.g., in localStorage).
   - Attach the token to the Authorization header of API requests that require authentication.

Suggested Sequence:
1. Phase 1 Set up database and backend connection
2. Phase 2 Create category and item tables in the database
3. Phase 3 Set up security and implement JWT authentication
4. Phase 4 Create registration and login system with JWT
5. Phase 5 Front-end integration with ReactJS
