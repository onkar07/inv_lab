 Phase A: Set Up Database and Backend Connection
1. Create Database Configuration: 
   - `application.properties`  
   - `DataSource.java`
   
2. Create Entity Classes for Database:
   - `Category.java`  
   - `Item.java`  
   
3. Create Repositories:
   - `CategoryRepository.java`
   - `ItemRepository.java`  

4. Database Initialization:
   - Verify that the tables are correctly created in the database and can be accessed.

 Phase B: Set Up Security and JWT Authentication
1. Set Up Spring Security:
   - `WebSecurityConfig.java`.

2. Implement JWT Authentication:
   - Create JWT utility classes for generating and parsing JWT tokens.
   - Create authentication and authorization filters to intercept requests and validate JWT tokens.

3. Create JWT-based Registration and Login:
   - Implement `User` registration (user creation) with password hashing.
   - Implement login to authenticate and generate JWT tokens for valid users.

4. Secure APIs with JWT:
   - Secure the backend API endpoints (like Category and Item CRUD operations) by adding JWT validation.
   - Only allow authorized users with valid tokens to access specific resources.

---

 Phase C: Create Registration & Login System
1. User Entity:
   - Create the `User` entity (youâ€™ve already defined `username`, `password`, `email`, and `roles`).
   - Include validation annotations for each field.

2. Create Registration Endpoint:
   - Implement an endpoint for new users to register (POST `/api/auth/register`).
   - Hash passwords using a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., BCrypt).

3. Create Login Endpoint:
   - Implement an endpoint for users to log in (POST `/api/auth/login`).
   - On successful login, generate and return a JWT token.
   
4. Test Authentication:
   - Test the registration and login functionality.
   - Make sure that the JWT token is generated and can be used for subsequent API calls.

---

 Phase D: Front-End Integration (ReactJS)
1. Create Front-End Registration and Login Forms:
   - Create forms for user registration and login in ReactJS.
   - Send requests to the Spring Boot backend for registration and login, and handle the JWT token in the frontend.

2. Handle JWT Token in React:
   - Store the JWT token securely in the browser (e.g., in localStorage).
   - Attach the token to the Authorization header of API requests that require authentication.

Suggested Sequence:
1. Phase A Set up database and backend connection
2. Phase B Set up security and implement JWT authentication
3. Phase C Create registration and login system with JWT
4. Phase D Front-end integration with ReactJS
